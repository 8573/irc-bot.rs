Quick-start
---

To use this library without writing one's own bot with it, run the provided
program `src/bin/egbot.rs`:

    $ # For most people:
    $ cargo run
    $ # For NixOS users:
    $ make run

The name `egbot` is derived from ["e.g."], which means "for example", and is
also a pun on the name of [Eggdrop], an old IRC bot.

["e.g."]: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/e.g.>
[Eggdrop]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggdrop>

The bot can be configured by editing the [JSON] file `config.json`, which is
passed through to [the `irc` crate], which documents its configuration options
[in its README file][`irc` config]. One should at least add one's IRC nick to
the `owners` field â€” e.g., if one's nick is ["Ferris"]:

    {
      "owners": ["Ferris"],
      ...
    }

Building
---

For most users, it should suffice to simply use **[Cargo]**:

    $ cargo build

[Cargo]: <http://doc.crates.io>

Users of the Linux distribution **[NixOS]** may prefer to use the provided
[`Makefile`], which wraps the tool `nix-shell`:

    $ make build

[NixOS]: <https://nixos.org>
[`Makefile`]: <https://github.com/8573/irc-bot.rs/blob/master/Makefile>
