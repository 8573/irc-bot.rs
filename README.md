language [Rust], additionally providing a pre-configured bot for immediate
use.

Quick-start
---

To use this library without writing one's own bot with it, run the provided
program `src/bin/egbot.rs`:

    $ # For most people:
    $ cargo run
    $ # For NixOS users:
    $ make run

The name `egbot` is derived from ["e.g."], which means "for example", and is
also a pun on the name of [Eggdrop], an old IRC bot.

["e.g."]: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/e.g.>
[Eggdrop]: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggdrop>

The bot can be configured by editing the [YAML] file `config.yaml`. One should
at least put one's IRC nick in the `admins` field â€” e.g., if one's nick is
["Ferris"]:

    admins:
      - nick: Ferris

Configuration fields currently supported are as follows (with values given for
example only):

    # A string to be used as the bot's IRC nickname. This field is required.
    nickname: egbot

    # A string to be used as the bot's IRC username (which has little effect
    # in most cases). Defaults to the nickname.
    username: egbot

    # A string to be used as the bot's IRC "realname" or "GECOS string", which
    # has still less effect and is often used to display information about a
    # bot's software. Defaults to displaying information about the bot's
    # software.
    realname: 'Built with `irc-bot.rs`.'

    # A list of servers to which the bot should connect on start-up.
    # Currently, only the first server will be used, and the bot will crash if
    # no servers are listed; both of these issues should be fixed at some
    # future point.
    servers:
      - host: irc.mozilla.org
        port: 6667 # Sadly, TLS connections are not yet implemented.

    # A list of IRC users who will be authorized to direct the bot to run
    # certain priviledged commands. For each listed user, the fields `nick`,
    # `user`, and `host` may be specified; for each of which that is
    # specified, a user will need to have a matching nickname, username, or
    # hostname (respectively) to be authorized. All the specified fields must
    # match for a user to be authorized.
    admins:
      # To be authorized as an administrator of the bot, this user will need
      # to have the nickname "Ferris", the username "~crab", and the hostname
      # "rustacean.net":
      - nick: Ferris
        user: '~crab'
        host: rustacean.net
      # To be authorized as an administrator of the bot, this user will only
      # need have the nickname "c74d":
      - nick: c74d

There is currently no way to specify in the configuration file which channels
the bot should join (this should be fixed), but one can send commands such as
`join #botters-test` to the bot in one-to-one messaging (more commonly called
"query").

Building
---

For most users, it should suffice simply to use **[Cargo]**:

    $ cargo build

[Cargo]: <http://doc.crates.io>

Users of the Linux distribution **[NixOS]** may prefer to use the provided
[`Makefile`], which wraps the tool `nix-shell`:

    $ make build

[NixOS]: <https://nixos.org>
[`Makefile`]: <https://github.com/8573/irc-bot.rs/blob/master/Makefile>
