    "The Rust version noted in the `image` field above is the minimum Rust
    version supported by this crate, as explained in the README.",

    "This file is nominally a YAML file, because `.gitlab-ci.yml` requires that
    it be so, but is written in the subset of YAML that is valid JSON, because
    `shell.nix` requires that it be so."
